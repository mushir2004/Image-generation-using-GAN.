Generative Adversarial Networks are technology in the field of image generation.
They consist of two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator.
At the time of training:
The Generator tries to fool the Discriminator by generating better and better images.
The Discriminator tries to get better at distinguishing real images from fake ones.
Their ability to create realistic images has significant implications for various industries, including entertainment, art, and scientific research.
